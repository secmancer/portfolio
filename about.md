Hello, my name is Adan Silva.
I am a college freshmen at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in CS. 
I am really interested in pursing a career in cybersecurity, in which I'm currently educating myself in.
I am currently CompTIA Security+ and ITF+ certified. 
I also participated in robotics during my high school years and also was one of the first students to successfully complete the CTE Cybersecurity path at my school. 
I love learning something new everyday!
